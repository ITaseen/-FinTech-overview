Trade and exchange are fundamental aspects of human civilization. They have shaped how societies interact, distribute resources, and grow economically. Understanding the history of trade and its evolution into modern financial systems is crucial for anyone exploring the world of fintech. 

Trade is the act of exchanging goods or services between individuals, groups, or nations. It can occur on a small scale, such as bartering between neighbors, or on a large scale, such as international trade agreements. Historically, trade enabled people to acquire resources they lacked and share surplus goods, creating mutual benefits and fostering cooperation.
