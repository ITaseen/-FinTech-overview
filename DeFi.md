Decentralized Finance (DeFi) refers to a system of financial applications that operates on blockchain networks, which are decentralized and open-source. DeFi platforms aim to provide financial services without relying on traditional centralized institutions like banks, instead utilizing smart contracts and blockchain to enable secure, peer-to-peer transactions.

Decentralization: Eliminates intermediaries by operating on decentralized networks, allowing users to transact directly with one another.

Transparency: Blockchain ensures all transactions are publicly recorded, promoting accountability and trust within the ecosystem.

Accessibility: Open to anyone with internet access, DeFi aims to provide financial services to people who are excluded from traditional financial systems.
